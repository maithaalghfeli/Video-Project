Coding 

The work got split between Maitha and me for the animations of the letters, the font, and the things that came along with it, such as the mouse scrolling downwards. Then, when it came to the coding part of this project, many issues came with it, from errors with the animation of the letters to the mouse wheel not cooperating with me, but in the end, we had it under control. This project was indeed a learning experience, and the partner in the coding part did justice to the whole of it.
