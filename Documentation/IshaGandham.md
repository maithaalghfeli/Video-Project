Project Name: Finding Maitha

Project Description: 
The website revolves around the video made titled Finding Maitha. The video is 5 minutes long and follows Insiya, Khalifa and I (Isha) who are trying to find their fourth team mate Maitha who they were supposed to work with for the assignment. They have creepy experiences while finding Maitha and eventually give up only to meet Maitha the next day, who acts like nothing happened, making the others question if the day while finding Maitha even happened. 

Process:
Due to uncertainty of getting a permit, we decided to film on campus and to base our video on option 4 where we're supposed to take the audience through various locations in a story that is coherent. We did that by thinking of a story that involves Maitha going missing and the others having to find her. The other teammates go through various locations around campus to find her and also, where they have creepy experiences. We shot near the convenience store, our classroom, outside the library and the basement. 
We all discussed and agreed on a story after which Insiya drafted a script for the video. We tried booking equipment from the Art Centre, however, they either didn't have some equipment, or didn't have it available for the days we needed to shoot or did not let us check out the equipment for when we needed it. After trying for two days, we decided to go ahead with the shoot using our phones, one to record the videos and another for sound. Due to not advanced sound equipment, it limited our choices of locations as it was hard to record dialogue in noisy areas of campus like the Marketplace, D2 or the Baraha. We chose quieter locations that could have added to the mystique and eerie experience of our video. 


Reflection:
We wanted to create a surreal experience for the audience due to which the video was edited with appropriate creepy sounds and effects on the video, especially the scenes with Maitha who goes missing. The scenes where it's creepy and Khalifa and I (Isha) aren't sure is real was given a red tint to distinguish it from the rest of the scenes. Shooting involved all of us, while I worked on editing the video. Khalifa and Maitha worked on the code along with Insiya to design the website. The audience is supposed to perceive it as creepy or surreal which I think we were successful in doing. It was a fun experience working with others on a video and website who come from different backgrounds and with a different skill set. I had a learning curve while editing the video and was helpful to get inputs from my teammates.
