# Finding Maitha Documentation:

Coding the website was pretty challenging even after all the previous sites we worked on, simply because of the pacing. Khalifa and I worked together to create the interface. After showing the video to multiple people for feedback we realised we needed to add to the storytelling element to make it more ominous, paced, and suspense filled. The video was cut down into smaller sections to add narration in the middle.
