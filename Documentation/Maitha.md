# Finding Maitha Documentation:

Coding the website was pretty challenging even after all the previous sites we worked on, simply because of the pacing. Khalifa and I worked together to create the interface. 

After showing the video to multiple people for feedback we realised we needed to add to the storytelling element to make it more ominous, paced, and suspense filled. The video was cut down into smaller sections to add narration in the middle. I worked on the story being told between the videos, with the hope of making it feel like we're stuck in an alternate reality, a sort of dreamworld where we question what we see. 

The typewriting effect was used to follow a horror-like feel. And the sounds as an addition to the user feedback. 

This website was created in the hopes of creating a fully immersive sensory experience for the user. It moves in a linear format to follow the story from start to end.

It was enjoyable working with my groupmemebers especially when it came to filming. There were a lot of laughs and jokes and reshoots which we enjoyed a lot.
