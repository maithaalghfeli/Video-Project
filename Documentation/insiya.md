### Project Description:

As Insiya, Isha and Khalifa meet up to work on the Video project, they discover that Maitha is missing! Follow along with their journey as they try to find their missing teammate and finish this assignment!

### Initial Idea:

We explored a lot of different ideas including filming a documentary off campus but we ended up deciding on the story line of a group member disappearing. We wanted to create a comedic mystery that would fit in at the campus locations. We decided to use option 4 and include shots at many locations across campus.

### Process:

##### Stage 1: Deciding the story

We first had to decide on the detailed story for our project. After deciding on our initial idea, I created a storyboard and script that included all the shots we would do as well as the lines we followed (although there was much improvisation) .                           
       
##### Stage 2: Filming

We tried to book the video equipment from Terry’s workshop but they were unavailable. We also tried to book the audio equipment and although we had access the equipment was already in use for the days we needed it so we were not able to have it for our shooting. We decided to use a our phones and a tripod to film all our clips and used a secondary phone to record just audio. We split up our filming in two days. First we filmed in the classroom and asked other students to participate. The second day, we met up in the morning to film all the other scenes. 

##### Stage 3: Editing

Isha edited the audio and videos together to create our final project. She also clipped the videos by locations so we could add them to our website.

##### Stage 4: Coding

We chose to create a simple website that focused on the different locations of the film and added to the mystery of the story. We tried to incorporate an SVG into our website and I created some designs for it including icons but since we structured it to have multiple pages that hosted each clip, it didn’t work out. Maitha and Khalifa worked on the code to make the final website. 

### Reflection:

Overall, this project was a fun way to experiment with video creation. We learned a lot and were able to be creative with our story.
